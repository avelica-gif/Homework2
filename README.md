# about-me

I updated my portfolio to make it look cleaner and add a customer avatar of myself. I actually added a small bio of myself. 

I am still very new to coding and was having a lot of trouble learning all 3 languages (HTML, CSS & JS).

I know my page is very simple, but believe me, it looks way better than the first time I created this. Slowly but surely. 

There has been many times where I think about giving up on this class but once I do things like fix my homework, it makes me feel better about myself and makes me want to push myself to become better and learn more. Nothing happens overnight, and that is something I need to keep on telling myself when I want to give up. 

I know right now all 3 pages look very plain and simple; but I can't express enough how much worse they used to look. 

I did buy a domain from GoDaddy to try to connect it using GitHub's A records but somehow it wasn't working so I took it off. 

Once I figure out why it wasn't connecting, this page will be deployed as avelicacodes.com
